# Work Day Scheduler

For busy employees and students alike, this web application allows the user to add important events to a daily planner in order for effective time management.

The use of third-party APIs such as Day.js, jQuery, Bootstrap, and Google Fonts allows for a higher quality user experience in planning the day ahead.
